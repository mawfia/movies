Individual Belt Exam Project created 19 January 2019 and completed 20 January 2019

INTRODUCTION:
--------------------
This is a MongoDB, Express.js, Angular 6, Node.js project designed, built, and deployed to cloud services over a period of 2 days.

INTRO:
--------------------

-This application was built as part of a Coding Dojo belt exam culminating 2 months of material including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, 
Bootstrap, Angular 6, Express, Node, Mongo and the various ways of using these technologies to develop a modern day application.  As the 
third belt exam we were given 48 hours to start and finsh an application including testing and deployment with the following requirements:

1. CRUD operations all working.
	a. Able to create new movies.
	b. All movies displayed upon visiting the website.
	c. User may choose to read the reviews of a particular movie
	d. Able to add reviews for each movie
	e. Able to delete each movie.
2. Routing.
	a. Root route redirects to'/movies' to display all the movies.
	b. Route 'movies/new' displays the form to create a new movie. (Successful create and cancel redirect to the root route)
	c. Route '/movies/:id' displays the reviews of a particular movie and the delete button.
	d. Route '/movies/:id/review' displays the form to add a new review for a particular movie.
3. Backend validations.
	a. All movies must have a title of at least 3 characters
	b. Upon creating a movie, a review must be provided.

HOW TO USE:
---------------------
This is a sample movie review page that allows you to read, write, or delete reviews.  Buttons are labelled according to their action.


TECHNOLOGY USED:
-----------------
1.  Node, Express, and Mongo were used for all backend and data storage logic.

2.  Node Package Manager was used to manage all module and library dependencies.

3.  Mongoose was used for back-end data validation and Angular were used for front-end form validation.

4.  SHA256 was used as a salt/hash algorithm to obsfuscate each user's password stored in Mongodb.

5.  Express.js, Nginx, and PM2 were used for server deployment, routing, and execution with data and template client-side service requests handled with Angular 6 and its routing dependency.

6.  The application is deployed on a AWS account for cloud services including Ubuntu configuration and management.
